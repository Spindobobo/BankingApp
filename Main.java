/**
 * Defining the problem:
 * Build a basic banking application with simple primary functions like database, deposit and withdraw.
 * Later, I should add new functions to the older ones as I progress through the development process, like an UI.
 * Finally, maybe implement SQL databases or APIs.
 *
 * Steps:
 * Create a class responsible for a database
 * Create a class responsible for depositing money
 * Create a class responsible for withdrawing money
 * Use the main method to create the app and execute all functions
