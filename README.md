# BankingApp


Defining the problem:

Build a banking application with functions regardind creating an account, checking balance, doing deposit and withdraw.
Later, I should add new functions to the older ones as I progress through the development process, like a SQL database or APIs.

Steps:

1. Create a class responsible for a database of bank accounts.
 - [x] Create variable for a name.
 - [x] Create variable for phone number.
 - [x] Create variable for e-mail.
 - [x] Create method to generate a random account number.
 - [x] Test to see if it's functioning.
 
2. Create a class responsible for transactions generally, including a way to verify balance, to deposit and to withdraw money.
 - [x] Create a variable and a method to verify balance.
 - [x] Create a variable and a method to do a deposit.
 - [x] Create a variable and a method to do a withdraw.
 - [x] Test to see if it's functioning.

3. Use the main method to create the app and execute all functions.
 - [x] Create an UI using the terminal
 - [x] Create a method to execute the function of balance.
 - [x] Create a method to execute the function of deposit.
 - [x] Create a method to execute the function of withdraw.

4. How to use it: download the project to an IDE like IntelliJ or VS Code, start it and input code in the terminal as it is requested. Pressing 1 should show you your balance, 2 should make a withdraw, 3 a deposit and 4 shuts down the terminal.
